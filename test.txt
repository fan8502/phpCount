TAIPEI, Taiwan ¡X The end is in sight for Yunlin's garbage mountain and a new day is dawning for Taiwan's waste disposal techniques, according to the Environmental Protection AdministrationLee Ying-yuan, head of the environmental authority, said Wednesday that Yunlin's garbage problem was "more or less solved."
Garbage has built up to the height of a four-story building in the Yunlin County capital Douliu, which has no working incinerators.
Yunlin relies on its neighbors to process its waste and, in return, stores a ratio of the ash that results from burning waste. When Douliu announced that it had no more space for ash, the reciprocal arrangement was broken off.
But Lee on Wednesday reported that Yunlin had already chipped down its garbage mountain to about 30 tons.
The central government helped arrange for Formosa Plastics Corp. (¥x¶ì) to take 60 tons, for Chiayi City to take 60 tons and for areas to the north and the south to take over 100 tons, Lee said.
He was speaking to reporters at the Democratic Progressive Party headquarters, where he gave a briefing on his ministry's plan for Taiwan's garbage.
Lee said that Yunlin needed to take an active approach to waste reduction and recycling, but that his ministry was also helping Yunlin build two facilities for rapid composting.
In addition, the ministry had earmarked NT$15.3 billion budget to bring in some of the latest waste treatment techniques, he said.
He said that every so often, there are new techniques and concepts for waste disposal: In the earliest waste treatment centers, garbage was buried, and then later it was incinerated.
Taiwan had recently begun converting a part of its garbage to renewable energy, bringing in mechanical biological treatment to produce biogas, soil improvers and other usable products, he said.
Lee said the NT$15.3 billion budget would go toward developing cutting-edge waste-processing infrastructure, such as new bacterial strains for faster and less malodorous decomposition of waste into fertilizer.
